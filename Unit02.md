**Unit 2: Strategic Planning** <span id="2"></span> 
*Strategic planning is the phase of strategic management that comes
after goals are defined but before the strategy is put into place.  In
this phase, the financial situation of your firm must be taken into
account.  For example, if your firm wants to grow, this usually involves
additional investment of capital.  If your firm does not have the cash
or the means to raise money to spend, then the goal may be dead in its
tracks. *  
  
 *Likewise, there are external issues that must be taken into
consideration.  Google cannot grow much in the advertising space market
without facing reviews from the Department of Justice for anti-trust
issues.  These are political issues, but there are also economic,
social, and technological concerns at play.  By considering these
factors, strategic planners can design a strategy that can be
implemented without being stalled or shut down by some unforeseen
issue. *  
  
 *There are many ways to analyze a system and develop a strategic plan. 
Hopefully, you will study the methods in this course, and then further
research systems that may be best catered to your desired industry of
employment. *

     Instructions:  This is a classic work about balance.  The ideas are
    abstract, but work to separate out the practical applications,
    noting how the internal and external environments are perceived. 
    For example, the phrase “When gold and jade fill the hall, their
    possessor cannot keep them safe” addresses the question of how much
    wealth a company ought to accumulate.  In other words, it may be
    better to distribute profits as they are made rather than build up a
    large store of cash which can be raided by competitors.  This is a
    challenging text to read and understand, but is useful and
    insightful.    
      
     Reading and studying this text should take approximately 10
    hours.
