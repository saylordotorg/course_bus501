**Unit 3: Creating Competitive Advantage** <span id="3"></span> 
*The success of a strategy depends on the firm’s competitive advantage,
or whether its position in a competitive market allows it to achieve its
goals—which might include higher returns on investments, greater
efficiency or superior effectiveness in comparison to competitors.  What
sets your product or service apart from the competition?  Two generic
strategies for developing a competitive advantage are cost leadership
and differentiation.  Cost leadership is a strategy that Walmart
follows.  This company aims to offer the lowest prices in order to draw
in customers.  Differentiation is a strategy designed to make your
product or service so unique that it stands out from the competition in
a desirable way to a target market.  Nintendo launched the Wii video
game consul by differentiating their product with motion sensitive
controllers.  (This company pursued a cost leadership strategy in
conjunction with this differentiation strategy.)*  
  
 *There are a number of ways to achieve competitive advantage, and they
all require a focus on the competitors.  It is important to keep this in
mind when studying this unit.  This unit’s primary takeaway should be
the concept of sustainable competitive advantage.  As soon as your
competitors see a strategy of yours working, they will either copy or
leapfrog it.  Sony immediately attempted to copy Nintendo by developing
its own motion-sensitive controllers, and Microsoft has moved to motion
recognition via cameras.  Sustainable competitive advantage involves not
only jumping ahead, but staying there. *
