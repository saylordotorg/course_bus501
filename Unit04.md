**Unit 4: Corporate Strategy** <span id="4"></span> 
*Corporate strategy is perhaps the most important strategy, because it
sets the metric by which all other strategies are formed within the
company.  For example, BMW has a focus on quality vehicles that they can
sell for a premium.  If a business unit of BMW decides to pursue a cost
leadership strategy that will not work well with the overall firm
strategy, it would be very difficult and could tarnish BMW’s brand
image, although that is not to say that it is impossible. *  
  
 *The subject of corporate strategy is vast; however, corporate
strategies are usually based around one central goal: growth.  It is up
to the management to determine the best way to achieve growth.  Some
prefer to integrate into the value chain, which was discussed in
sub-sub-unit 3.1.3 of this course.  For BMW, this would mean pursuing
opportunities to produce parts for its cars instead of paying
contractors.  Other firms may want to grow by diversifying.  While a
firm like GE, which has produced engines, financial products and
entertainment programming, can diversify across industries, most
diversify with closely-related industries.  BMW also makes motorcycles
and owns the Mini and Rolls-Royce brands, which cater to different
markets than do BMW vehicles.  Companies may create subsidiaries,
different branches of a major company, in order to cater to these
different markets.  For example, in educational textbook publishing, a
company like Pearson Education also has subsidiaries (although this
company has since moved to combine these subsidiaries into the whole of
Pearson Education, Inc.).  The subsidiaries Prentice Hall and
Addison-Wesley focus on specific fields, such as mathematics and
economics, in which to market textbooks.  At one point, these
subsidiaries competed against each other, while at the same time both
brought in market share for the Pearson Education company as a whole. 
Pearson Education has since merged these subsidiaries, although it has
kept the names for branding, and now focuses on selling its products
without this internal competition. *  
  
 *This unit focuses on the various methods a firm can use to pursue
growth.  Growing is not just about buying the competition, because that
is not always possible or expeditious.  This unit will explore why that
is and how to determine the best strategy for growth. *
