Course Syllabus for "BUS501: Strategic Management"
--------------------------------------------------

What is strategy?  When your friend tells you that his “strategy” in
basketball is to win, he is not telling you a strategy at all.  A
strategy is a plan of action designed to achieve a goal—in the case of
your friend, a more appropriately defined strategy for his basketball
game would be: “I am going to apply defensive pressure and force the
opposing team to make mistakes with the end goal of winning the game.” 
In this course, you will learn that you must first clearly define your
goals before you develop strategies in order to achieve them.  You will
also learn that strategy in business is similar to strategy in sports,
war, or politics; the parallels are so close that early business
strategists studied military strategies in depth.  The science of
strategy development has developed beyond this by now, but the parallels
still exist. Strategic Management involves two processes: first, the
process of identifying specific goals for a firm and designing
strategies to achieve those goals, and second, the process of
implementing those strategies.  It is easy to say that your goal is to
increase sales by 50% in three years, but how do you go about achieving
that goal?  Are you going to lower prices, acquire a competitor, move
into other businesses, or something else?  Assuming you are going to
lower prices, how are you going to do so and keep profits up?  These are
the sorts of questions that strategists must answer. This course is the
capstone of the business major, because it incorporates elements from
all of the core courses you should have already completed.  Almost every
topic should be familiar to you to some degree; however, Strategic
Management ties them all together.  This course begins with an
introduction to the field and the definition of some important terms and
concepts.  You will then move  on to identifying goals and formulating
strategies before addressing implementation topics.  This course will
conclude with strategies for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.  This course
should be taken after all core courses have been completed and, ideally,
near the end of your completion of the elective courses.

    Building New Markets by Unleashing Disruptive
    Innovation”](http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/3374.html)

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
 Pay special attention to Unit 1 as it lays the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material  
 presented in later units.  You will also need to complete:  

-   Unit 1 Quiz and Thought Question
-   Unit 2 Quiz and Thought Question
-   Unit 3 Quiz and Thought Question
-   Unit 4 Quiz and Thought Question
-   Unit 5 Quiz and Thought Question
-   Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
 However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the quizzes and  
 thought questions for each unit.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of
**62.25 hours **to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. 
These should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to
take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set
goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you approximately
7.5 hours to complete.  Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and
decide to complete the introduction and subunit 1.1 (a total of 3 hours)
on Monday night; subunits 1.2, 1.3, and the Unit 1 Assessment (a total
of 4.5 hours) on Tuesday night; etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** Please take comprehensive notes on each
resource.  Keep the learning outcomes at the beginning of each unit in
mind as you take notes.  These notes will help serve as a study guide as
you prepare for your Final Exam.  Try to keep your answers to the
quizzes and thought questions organized; reviewing these will also help
you practice for the Final Exam.
