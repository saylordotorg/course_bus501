**Unit 5: 21st Century Strategy** <span id="5"></span> 
*Research in strategy really picked up steam in the 20<sup>th</sup>
century.  However, new research shows that there are other factors that
can seriously impact strategies.  For example, the use of psychology in
business has moved up in the strategic planning world.  Managers used to
assume that all employees were the same and that all employees would do
what they are told.  We now know that employees are unique and motivated
by different goals themselves.  Understanding the culture of a firm and
what motivates employees will allow strategy managers to extract more
out of each individual. *  
  
 *Additionally, the idea of innovation as a strategy leader has
complemented the competitive advantage strategy.  There are issues with
getting to the top of an industry by innovating and then falling behind
to rising competitors.  Collectively, these issues are known as the
innovator’s dilemma, and technology companies have been fighting tooth
and nail to avoid falling victim to this problem (as have many other
industries).  One way to avoid this dilemma is by maintaining a high
level of cash and simply acquiring the innovating companies.  From 2007
through 2009, Google acquired 24 companies (that were disclosed) and
Microsoft acquired 34. *  
  
 *Finally, as globalization makes the world a real global economy, the
focus of strategy must go beyond the borders of your own country. 
Technology has enabled even small companies of just a few people to
outsource work to the other side of the world.  A global view will be
essential to any 21<sup>st</sup> century strategy. *
